<h1>My Portfolio in React</h1> 

If you are asking yourself why there are insects on my Portfolio, it is because they call me Buba ( English-bug ) so I used it as a style implementation. :D
It is awkward to be a developer and be called with the nickname Bug 

<h2>How is it made:</h2>
<li>Putting an About Me and CV file and basic info.</li>
<li>Making my own Carousel for the work section that renders project objects in an array.</li>
<li>Make a section for contact.</li>
<li>Implementing a self-build scroll bar that fills like a spider web when scrolled, with a spider at the end of the scroll bar.</li>
<li>Making an animation of a bug at the end.</li>
