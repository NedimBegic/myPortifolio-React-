<h1>My Portfolio in React</h1> 

If you are asking yourself why there are insects on my Portfolio, it is because they call me Buba ( English-bug ) so I used it as a style implementation. ÔÅä 

<h2>How is it made:</h2>
-	Putting an About Me and CV file and basic info.
-	Making my own Carousel for the work section that renders project objects in an array.
-	Make a section for contact.
-	Implementing a self-build scroll bar that fills like a spider web when scrolled, with a spider at the end of the scroll bar.
-	Making an animation of a bug at the end.
